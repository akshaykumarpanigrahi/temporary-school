   <p>Ravindra Bharathi Public School was established during the year 1983-'84 with only sixteen students. Slowly and gradually, year after year, the strength has increased to 20000+ as well as the standard has been raised by the unrelenting efforts of the founder and Correspondent Sri.V.Venkateswara Rao Garu and Madam Vijaya Lakshmi Garu and the Director, Sri V.Vamsi Krishna Garu who joined later in their efforts and the efficient and experienced faculties.</p>

<p>We have provided a separate campus for Jabilli Play School consisting of spacious and well ventilated A.C. rooms which are provided for the Nursery, L.K.G. & U.K.G. Classes. The campus is modern and consists of well ventilated and well furnished rooms. The children are being supplied with aqua-guard water for drinking. Clean and healthy atmosphere is maintained through out. Our school has a play ground accommodating all types of games and sports.</p>
